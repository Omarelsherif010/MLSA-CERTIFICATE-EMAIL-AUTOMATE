# Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador Certificate Automation and Email Automation

This repo simply uses a template certificate docx file and generates certificates in 
both docx and pdf formats and triggers emails from the email that is set as sender email with the certificate attachement.

The initial template of this repository is borrowed from @muhammedogz,  who also is an Microsoft learn student ambassador. you can find him [here][1]
